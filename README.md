# Ubuntu-Server-Auto-Update

Dumb server updater I use for my personal servers. You have to use something such as `screen` or `p2m` to set it up but I am too lazy to be bothered with updating my servers so this just auto-updates it every week. This program requires admin permissions in the first place so make sure that you are running it with admin perms.
